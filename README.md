# quantum-open-stuff

Quantum Open Stuff is a running list of quantum computing-related open source software and resources. I hope to keep these lists updated on a regular basis.

[Quantum Computing Frameworks & Libraries](https://github.com/Steve-Andrew-Lynch/quantum-open-stuff/blob/master/resources-for-developers.md)

[Quantum Computing Environment Simulation Tools](https://github.com/Steve-Andrew-Lynch/quantum-open-stuff/blob/master/tools-for-developers.md)

[Quantum-Safe (maybe!) Cryptography Projects](https://github.com/Steve-Andrew-Lynch/quantum-open-stuff/blob/master/crypto-projects.md)
